# Machine-Learning-Model-based-CTR-Prediction

## Introduction
In the realm of online advertising, the click-through rate (CTR) stands as a paramount metric
for evaluating the effectiveness of ad campaigns. The ability to accurately predict CTR is crucial
in various aspects: Predicting CTR helps optimize ad campaigns for better performance and
maximize return on investment by focusing on high-CTR ads. It will help to create more relevant
and targeted ads for better engagement and enhance user satisfaction by delivering personalized
content. As a result, it can provide a competitive advantage in the advertising landscape. By
enhancing CTR prediction accuracy, this project aims to drive improvements in ad targeting, user
engagement, and overall advertising effectiveness, ultimately benefiting stakeholders across the
digital advertising ecosystem.

## Data and Code
The data is from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/avazu-ctr-prediction/overview). The code has been uploaded to the repo. 

## Summary
- Used advertisement CTR(Click through rate) data sets to predict whether an advertisement will be clicked after each
impression via Python.
- Utilized EDA and visualization to explore data patterns, along with data cleaning.
- Performed frequency encoding, data split and standardization before model training.
- Built and trained logistic regression, k-nearest-neighbors, random forest and XGBoost with 5-fold cross validation,
fine-tuned parameters in regularization term and attained best F1 score = 0.91
